    <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Lotto Chain<br>
    <strong>Phrase:</strong> Decentralized Betting</p>
    <p>
      Lotto Chain is a smart contract-based blockchain platform designed to be one of the safest and most efficient decentralized betting systems. The platform also provides supporting services such as various transparent betting concepts, and administrative contract management in the environment and development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project has reached the production stage and is ready to be used in a real ecosystem, although its operation is still in the beta version framework and has not been officially commercialized publicly.
    </p>

    <h2>B. User Agreement</h2>

    <h2>C. Platform Access and Availability</h2>
    <p>
      Lotto Chain is an active platform that has been technically developed and can be used on an open system (public) scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      This platform is commercialized for the general public and is available to the internal community or parties with official access.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development team has the right to prevent or restrict user access without prior notice if system abuse, exploitation,
      or violation of relevant laws are found.
    </p>

    <h2>D. Use of Utilities</h2>
    <p>
      The utilities used in Lotto Chain have internal functions in the system and can be claimed as legal financial rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utilities are official payment instruments, not stocks, not collateral, and can be legally traded outside the system
      without the user's own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no fixed conversion to fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies, because they are volatile and speculative.
    </p>
    <p>
      All token activities are carried out in a commercial and internal context, at the risk of each.
      Lotto Chain does not have the property rights or liquidity value of the personal user.

    </ul>

    <h2>F. Disclaimer</h2>
